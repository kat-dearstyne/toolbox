description_of_artifact: A User story is a concise, informal description of a software
  feature or functionality, written from the perspective of the end user. It is a
  key artifact in Agile software development, used to capture and prioritize requirements.
  User stories differ from other software artifacts, such as use cases or functional
  specifications, in that they are intentionally brief, focusing on the user's needs
  and goals, and are typically written in everyday language. They are meant to foster
  collaboration and communication between the development team and stakeholders, rather
  than serving as a detailed technical specification.

generations2sources:
  ? As a game developer, I want DebugOptions and FPSCounter classes to display debugging
    information like FPS, so that I can analyze performance and diagnose issues.: []
  ? As a game developer, I want Shader and ShaderProgram classes to handle loading,
    compiling, linking, and managing shader programs, so that I can render graphics
    using modern shader-based OpenGL.:
  - /Rendering/Shader.cpp
  - /Rendering/ShaderProgram.cpp
  ? As a game developer, I want UI Component classes like Button and Menu to implement
    reusable UI elements, so that I can create an in-game user interface.: []
  ? As a game developer, I want a Player class to store player state, apply movement,
    handle collisions, perform raycasting for block selection, and render the player,
    so that I can implement a controllable character that interacts with the 3D world.:
  - /Player.cpp
  ? As a game developer, I want a RenderEngine class to handle window creation, OpenGL
    context, camera view, and scene rendering, so that I have a reusable graphics
    engine for displaying 3D scenes.:
  - /Rendering/RenderEngine.cpp
  ? As a game developer, I want an AABB class for collision detection using axis-aligned
    bounding boxes, so that I can implement basic collision between game objects.:
  - /Utils/AABB.cpp
  ? As a game developer, I want an Image class to load image files as textures using
    STB Image, so that I can apply detailed textures to 3D models.:
  - /Rendering/Image.cpp
  - /Rendering/stb_image.cpp
  ? As a game developer, I want classes to represent in-game entities like Block,
    Chunk, and World to manage individual blocks, chunks of blocks, and the entire
    world, so that I can structure the 3D game world in a modular way.:
  - /World/Block.cpp
  - /World/Chunk.cpp
  - /World/World.cpp
  As a game developer, I want exception handling with call stack traces, so that I can properly handle and debug crashes.: []
  ? As a game developer, I want to initialize a game engine by constructing a Game
    object that initializes a RenderEngine for handling window creation and 2D/3D
    rendering, loads a WorldScreen representing the main game screen, and runs a main
    loop for event handling, updating, and rendering, so that I have a reusable game
    engine framework.:
