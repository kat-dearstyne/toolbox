description_of_artifact: A User story is a concise, informal description of a software
  feature or functionality, written from the perspective of the end user. It is a
  key artifact in Agile software development, used to capture and prioritize requirements.
  User stories differ from other software artifacts, such as use cases or functional
  specifications, in that they are intentionally brief, focusing on the user's needs
  and goals, and are typically written in everyday language. They are meant to foster
  collaboration and communication between the development team and stakeholders, rather
  than serving as a detailed technical specification.
