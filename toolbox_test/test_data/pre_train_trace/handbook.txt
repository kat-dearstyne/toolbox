Definition of motor vehicle: The International Convention on Road Signs and Signals defines a motor or power driven vehicle as a self propelled road vehicle. Rail borne vehicles and country specifically mopeds which are not treated as motorcycles are exceptions. A second definition in this convention limits the term motor vehicle to those vehicles which are used for carrying persons or goods or for drawing on the road vehicles used for the carriage or persons or goods. Electrically powered non rail borne trolley buses are included in this definition. This definition however does not cover vehicles, such as agricultural tractors, which are only incidentally used for carrying persons or goods.
An appropriate definition is established for example in the German Road Traffic Act and in the laws of other countries.
Functional units of a motor vehicle A motor vehicle consists of a number of functional units . These are usually classified into drivetrain, drive unit, chassis, vehicle body, and electrical system. This classification is however not standardized.
The functional units are composed of the subsystems, which are interconnected. But there is also an interaction between the functional units. Thus, for example, the drive unit acts on the transmission unit with the transmission subsystem, which drives the wheels of the chassis functional unit via the drive shafts and the final drive differential.
Electrical and electronic systems have gradually found their way into all areas of a motor vehicle. They have replaced mechanical systems or else created completely new possibilities. Electrification of the drive and further developments in the field of automated driving have major impacts on motor vehicle development.
Classification of motor : vehicles Motor vehicles include motor cars, but also single track motorcycles . Commercial vehicles included trucks, motor buses, and tractors. Determination of motor vehicles Passenger cars Passenger cars Passenger cars have at least four wheels. They are also called automobiles. Passenger cars serve to transport persons and additionally luggage, but also goods. A trailer can also be towed.
vides an overview of the vehicle categories in Europe. This classification applies to the countries of the European Union and all other European countries.
least one rear axle, both of which can be driven simultaneously . The drive to one of the axles can be disengaged.
SUVs are based : in terms of design on off road vehicles, but do not satisfy all the above mentioned requirements. Off road capability varies from model to model. In fact, they are for the most part not used in off road applications at all.
Vehicle categories of other countries Vehicle categories of other countries Japanese legislation follows the classification of CARB. China and India follow the EU classification.

Quantities and units: In order to be able to express the values of physical quantities, a system of units is required which serves as the yardstick for every measurement. The value of the physical quantity is taken as the product of numerical value and unit. Such a system of units is the SI system, which was established in 1960 by the 11th General Conference on Weights and Measures . It has since then been adopted by over 50 countries.
In Germany the management of units is by law under the control of the Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt in Sevres near Paris.
Further units which are to this day commonly used are in Germany likewise permitted by law and are mentioned here as such.
SI units  SI means "Systeme International d'Unites" .
Definition of the base SI units In 2018 a fundamental change was made to the SI at the 26th General Conference, this change being adopted on 20 May 2019: Seven "defining constants" now form the foundation of the SI and therefore provide the basis for the definition of the base units and all further SI units .
Second The second, symbol s, is the SI unit of time. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the cesium frequency DnCs, the unperturbed ground state hyperfine transition frequency of the cesium 133 atom to be 9 192 631 770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s 1.
In other words, one second is equal to the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the energy of the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the unperturbed ground state of the 133Cs atom.
